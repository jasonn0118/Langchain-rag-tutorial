# Product Requirements Document: News RAG Pipeline

## Overview
Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain to process, categorize, and retrieve news articles relevant to financial data, with a focus on Nasdaq-related news. The system should ingest news from various sources, filter and tag relevant articles, embed them for semantic search, and allow user-driven retrieval.

## Goals
- Automatically ingest news from multiple sources (RSS feeds)
- Filter and categorize news for financial relevance (especially Nasdaq)
- Tag news articles with ticker symbols when mentioned
- Store only relevant news in a vector store for efficient retrieval
- Enable users to query and retrieve relevant news articles

## Software Principles & Best Practices
- Follow SOLID principles:
  - **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each module/class should have one responsibility.
  - **Open/Closed Principle:** Code should be open for extension, closed for modification.
  - **Liskov Substitution Principle:** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
  - **Interface Segregation Principle:** Prefer small, specific interfaces over large, general ones.
  - **Dependency Inversion Principle:** Depend on abstractions, not concretions.
- Write modular, maintainable, and testable code
- Use clear naming conventions and documentation
- Prefer composition over inheritance where possible
- Handle errors and edge cases gracefully
- Ensure code is extensible for future data sources or requirements

## Requirements

### 1. News Feed Ingestion
- Use RSS feeds to gather news from multiple reputable sources
- Parse and normalize news articles (title, content, date, source)

### 2. Categorization & Filtering
- Classify news articles as financial or non-financial
- Further categorize financial news as Nasdaq-related or not
- Use LLM-based or rule-based classification as appropriate

### 3. Ticker Tagging
- Detect and extract ticker symbols (e.g., AAPL, MSFT) from news content
- Tag articles with the relevant ticker(s) or unique IDs

### 4. Embedding & Storage
- Embed only relevant (financial, Nasdaq-related) news articles using OpenAI or similar embeddings
- Store embeddings and metadata in a vector store (e.g., MemoryVectorStore)

### 5. Retrieval
- Allow users to query the system for news related to specific topics or tickers
- Retrieve and present the most relevant news articles using semantic search

## Success Criteria
- Accurate ingestion and normalization of news feeds
- High precision in financial/Nasdaq news classification
- Correct tagging of ticker symbols
- Efficient and accurate retrieval of relevant news articles
- Modular, maintainable code using LangChain best practices
